Hi Frontend Mentor team,

Iâ€™ve completed the Recipe Page challenge! ðŸŽ‰ It was a great opportunity to practice my HTML and CSS skills while ensuring the design matches the given reference as closely as possible.

Thank you for providing such an engaging challenge. I really enjoyed working on it and learned a lot in the process. Looking forward to tackling more challenges!
